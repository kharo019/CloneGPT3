This project is a clone website from Adrianhajdin YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F627pKNUCVQ&list=WL&index=44) 
His YouTube videos has helped me a lot on how to use Master JavaScript the proper way and in this video we use a lot of ReactJS which has shown to me that is a great tool and easier to build and edit websites
